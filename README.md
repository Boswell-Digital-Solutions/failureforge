# FailureForge

Sandbox-only failure-harvesting subsystem and read-only governance evidence
bridge for Forge. Implementation-complete planning artifacts are archived under
`Drive/Forge/Plans/Implemented/failureforge` (see `docs/plans/IMPLEMENTED_PLAN_ARCHIVES.md`). This directory implements Slices 01-24:

- **Slice 01** - `FailureCase.v1`, `FailureHarvestReceipt.v1`, `SandboxRun.v1`,
  `HardeningReport.v1` contracts, Edge-Case Agent, sandbox run script, replay
  script, sample receipt, and sample hardening report.
- **Slice 02** - Receipt validation gate with schema validation,
  required-field checks, and immutable receipt hashes.
- **Slice 03** - Hardening report ranking with recommended fixes, receipt IDs,
  and replay commands.
- **Slice 04** - DataForge Local persistence shape, service boundary, and push
  client integration.
- **Slice 05** - Read-only operator report surface and morning-report CLI.
- **Slice 06** - Operator approval and SMITH handshake through typed receipts
  and an identity-gated FSM.
- **Slice 07** - Multi-agent expansion across chaos, mutation, reproduction,
  and classification lanes.
- **Slice 08** - Centipede root-cause clustering and ranked fix-cluster reports.
- **Slice 09** - NeuroForge comparative adjudication with model receipts and a
  deterministic final classification rule.
- **Slice 10** - Governance reconciliation, ERA/AAR read-only bridge
  contracts, and local proof gates.
- **Slice 11** - Target adapter guard contract for explicit, copy-only
  expansion beyond demo targets.
- **Slice 12** - External target source gate requiring a validated adapter
  before probing any non-default source path.
- **Slice 13** - Adapter preflight enforcement for required commands and
  forbidden canonical-source paths.
- **Slice 14** - Adapter-aware replay for external target-source receipts.
- **Slice 15** - Replay command context for adapter-backed target-source
  receipts.
- **Slice 16** - Per-run canonical source fingerprinting in `SandboxRun.v1`.
- **Slice 17** - Fail-closed canonical mutation handling before receipt writes.
- **Slice 18** - CLI canonical mutation exit handling for fail-closed runs.
- **Slice 19** - CLI replay canonical mutation exit handling.
- **Slice 20** - Runtime replay canonical mutation guard.
- **Slice 21** - Replay mismatch artifact status alignment.
- **Slice 22** - CLI replay receipt validation before target lookup.
- **Slice 23** - Malformed JSON handling in `verify-receipts`.
- **Slice 24** - CLI target adapter load validation.

## Doctrine

- All destructive testing happens against **copied workspaces**, never against
  canonical repos.
- Receipts are immutable after write. Modifying a receipt invalidates its hash
  and fails verification.
- No direct patch promotion: operator approval and SMITH handoff are mediated
  by explicit promotion/approval receipts and FSM checks.
- Every reproducible failure has a replay command. Non-reproducible failures
  are explicitly marked.
- Cluster generation preserves source disagreement instead of flattening lane
  evidence into a single opaque result.
- NeuroForge provider votes can confirm or dispute a cluster, but final
  classification stays derived from deterministic cluster evidence.
- ERA exports and AAR seeds are read-only bridge artifacts; they cannot claim
  fixes, bypass operator review, or mark evidence safe to autofix.
- Target adapters declare supported attack families and canonical mutation
  guards before a non-demo target can be probed.
- Explicit target source paths require target adapters; the demo target path
  remains the only adapter-optional execution route.
- Adapter preflight blocks missing tools or forbidden source paths before any
  workspace copy.
- Replay can use adapter-backed external target sources and applies the same
  preflight guard before copying a replay workspace.
- Receipts from adapter-backed runs carry the target-source and adapter replay
  arguments needed to reproduce the same source context.
- Sandbox runs record canonical source hashes before and after execution.
- If canonical source hashes differ, the run fails with no accepted receipts.
- The CLI maps canonical source mutation failures to exit code `5`.
- Replay uses the same canonical mutation exit code and suppresses replay JSON
  after fail-closed mutation errors.
- Replay records its own run artifact and fails closed if canonical source
  hashes change during replay.
- Replay mismatch artifacts are marked failed and carry exit code `2`, matching
  the CLI result.
- Replay validates receipt schema and hash before resolving a target source.
- Receipt verification reports malformed JSON as a validation failure without a
  traceback.
- Adapter file load failures return controlled CLI validation errors.

## Execution isolation (read this before pointing it at untrusted targets)

The "sandbox" is a **filesystem copy**, not an OS isolation boundary. The runner
copies the target into `sandbox/workspaces/` and then imports and executes the
target's `registry.py` **in-process**, with the full privileges of the runner.
Nothing constrains what that code can do — it can open sockets, write outside the
workspace, or spawn processes.

The `canonical_source_hash_before`/`_after` guard is **detective, not
preventive**, and it is scoped only to the canonical *source tree*: it fails the
run (exit `5`) if that directory changed during execution, but it does not stop a
target from causing other side effects. The demo target ships intentionally safe
code. **Before running a non-demo or untrusted target, wrap the run in real OS
isolation** (container, seccomp, read-only root FS, no network).

## Cross-repo slices

Slices 04–06 and the governance-reconciliation half of Slice 10 exercise the
FailureForge → DataForge Local handshake, whose service/router code lives in the
sibling **`dataforge-Local`** repo (and needs FastAPI). Those tests skip cleanly
when this repo is checked out standalone (e.g. in its own CI); they run when
`dataforge-Local` is present alongside this repo and FastAPI is installed.

> **Open gap (2026-09-30).** `dataforge-Local` does not contain `app/failureforge/`.
> With the sibling present and FastAPI installed, these tests do not skip; the
> `app.failureforge` imports inside them are expected to fail. See
> [`docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`](docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md), FF-20260930-001.

DataForge Local is specified to own the operator API and persistence-facing
Slice 04-18 integration under `dataforge-Local/app/failureforge/`. That package
does not exist in `dataforge-Local` today; see
[`docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`](docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md), FF-20260930-001.
