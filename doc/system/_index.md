        # failureforge - Compiled System Reference

        **Designation:** FFG
        **Document role:** Canonical compiled technical reference for failureforge
        **Source:** `doc/system/`
        **Build command:** `bash doc/system/BUILD.sh`
        **Document version:** 2.0 (2026-06-22) - canonical compliance migration
        **Protocol:** BDS Documentation Protocol v2.0; BDS Repo Documentation System Canonical Compliance Standard

        Assembly contract:

        - Command: `bash doc/system/BUILD.sh`
        - Validation: `bash doc/system/validate_snapshots.sh` runs during assembly
        - Primary output: `doc/FFGSYSTEM.md`

        This `doc/system/` tree is the canonical source of truth for failureforge. It uses
        explicit **truth classes**: canonical facts define repo role, authority
        boundaries, contract behavior, runtime behavior, and verification doctrine;
        snapshot facts are dated, audit-derived counts and current implementation
        inventory that may drift between audits.
